# Early Careers Software Engineering Program Coding Assignment

## Overview
This project is a web-based application designed to help users find restaurant information within a specified UK postcode area. It uses the Just Eat API to fetch and display restaurant data such as name, cuisines, rating, and address. The webpage is online as [a GitHub Page](https://tilosmsh.github.io/jet_homework/) and the backend is deployed on Google Cloud.

## Features
- Enter a UK postcode to fetch restaurant data.
- Displays the name, cuisine types, rating, and address of each restaurant, as well as their logos.
- Limit the display to the first 10 restaurants for clarity.


## How to Use
- Open [the GitHub Page](https://tilosmsh.github.io/jet_homework/) in your web browser.
- Enter a valid UK postcode into the input field.
- Click the "Search" button to retrieve and display the restaurant information.

## Technology Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- API: Just Eat API


## Assumptions
- The application assumes that all provided postcodes are valid UK postcodes. A mechanism to detect valid UK postcode is deployed.

## Potential Improvements
- Implement more comprehensive error handling mechanisms to manage different types of API response failures more robustly.
- Add functionality to filter or sort the restaurant listings (e.g., rating, cuisine type).
- Improve the UI/UX design to make the application more engaging and easier to navigate (e.g., display locations using GoogleMaps, search using other criteria, etc.).
